# Mapping_Earthquakes




## Basic Project Plan

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Tools used : 
1. Mapbox provides custom maps for websites and applications such as Strava, Facebook, the Financial Times, The Weather Channel, Snapchat, and Instacart. Since October 2019, Mapbox has been generating up to 14 billion individual sensor readings daily across 100,000 map updates on connected devices.

The Leaflet CSS and JavaScript files we added to the index.html file are referred to as content delivery networks (CDNs). Using CDNs has a security risk. To avoid the security risk, it's a best practice to include an integrity value with the CDN. Each file we added has its own integrity value, which is a Base64-encoded cryptographic hash of a resource that prevents the CDN from being hacked.
